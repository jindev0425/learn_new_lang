# learn_new_lang

## Motivation
Learning language can be more personalized. 
Rather than staring from sentences that are not commonly used, starting with the sentences, expressions that you commonly use. Generously introducing words/phrases that you commonly use in conversation and slowsly convert. 

## Interface 
* Chat agent that you chat with. Can take multiple roles (e.g., server, friend, teacher) or situation (e.g,. asking for a way, recommendation)
* You naturally speak with the person.

## Learning Stages1. 
1. Exposure & Observation: Natural conversation. Your language is translated (not just sentence to sentence, but in a more animated way to help user know what is this word in foreign language word). View your sentence in native language and Foreign language side-by-side.
2. Using Words: Start selecting from multiple choice.
3. Voice / Speak sentences
